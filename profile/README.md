Common Repo is a Git Based mirror of the WordPress.org Plugin Repository.

Consistantly updated. User requests through repo switcher also check if there's a version missmatch.

Roadmap:
- authors will be allowed to claim plugins. Through the Common Repo system, they will be able to push code (through Git), which will be available through the repository.
